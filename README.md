# RB-Lipsync-Tools
 Various Tools to work with Rock Band Lipsync Files


## Lipsync Converter

Takes an RB4 "rbsong" file, grabs all lipsync data and outputs up to 4 .lipsync files to be used in RB2 or 3.

Usage: Drag an "rbsong" file onto the script, or use it in a batch to convert multiple files in a folder. The files will have the same name as the input file with a number indicating the part and ending in .lipsync.
